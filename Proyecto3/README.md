* **scheduler/**: This directory contains the source files of the
scheduling algorithms implementation.
* **main.tex**: This is a template of the presentation, defines
the basic as the names of the authors and a cover page.
* **algorithmsFile.tex**: This is the output .tex file generated by the
program, imported by main.tex
